Sure, here is a shell script that uses `openssl` to generate a Bitcoin private key and derive the corresponding public key. This script assumes you have `openssl` installed on your system.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Generate a new private key
openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -noout -out private_key.pem

# Convert the private key to hexadecimal format
PRIVATE_KEY_HEX=$(openssl ec -in private_key.pem -text -noout | grep "priv:" -A 3 | tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n[:space:]:')

# Display the private key in hexadecimal format
echo "Private Key (hex): $PRIVATE_KEY_HEX"

# Derive the public key
openssl ec -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem

# Convert the public key to hexadecimal format
PUBLIC_KEY_HEX=$(openssl ec -in private_key.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 65 | xxd -p -c 65)

# Display the public key in hexadecimal format
echo "Public Key (hex): $PUBLIC_KEY_HEX"

# Clean up generated files
rm private_key.pem public_key.pem
```


It's important to note that deriving a private key from a public key in Bitcoin is not feasible due to the nature of elliptic curve cryptography. The process of generating a public key from a private key is a one-way function, meaning it cannot be reversed. This is what ensures the security of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the process:

1. **Generate a Private Key:** A private key is a randomly generated 256-bit number.
2. **Generate a Public Key:** The private key is then used to generate a public key through elliptic curve multiplication, which is a one-way mathematical function.
3. **Generate a Bitcoin Address:** The public key is then hashed to produce a Bitcoin address.

Here's a simplified Python example demonstrating the generation of a public key from a private key:

```python
from ecdsa import SigningKey, SECP256k1

# Generate a random private key
private_key = SigningKey.generate(curve=SECP256k1)
private_key_hex = private_key.to_string().hex()

# Generate the corresponding public key
public_key = private_key.get_verifying_key()
public_key_hex = public_key.to_string().hex()

print("Private Key:", private_key_hex)
print("Public Key:", public_key_hex)
```

In this example, the `ecdsa` library is used to generate a private key and then derive the corresponding public key using the SECP256k1 curve, which is the elliptic curve used by Bitcoin.

For security reasons, always keep your private key secure and never share it. If someone has access to your private key, they can control your Bitcoin.
**Explanation:**

1. **Generate a Private Key:**
   - `openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -noout -out private_key.pem`: Generates a new EC private key using the secp256k1 curve and saves it to `private_key.pem`.

2. **Convert Private Key to Hexadecimal:**
   - The private key is extracted from the PEM file, converted to hexadecimal, and stored in the `PRIVATE_KEY_HEX` variable.

3. **Derive the Public Key:**
   - `openssl ec -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem`: Derives the public key from the private key and saves it to `public_key.pem`.

4. **Convert Public Key to Hexadecimal:**
   - The public key is extracted from the PEM file in DER format, converted to hexadecimal, and stored in the `PUBLIC_KEY_HEX` variable.

5. **Display Keys:**
   - Both the private and public keys are printed in hexadecimal format.

6. **Clean Up:**
   - The generated PEM files are removed.

To run the script, save it to a file (e.g., `generate_keys.sh`), make it executable (`chmod +x generate_keys.sh`), and then execute it (`./generate_keys.sh`).
